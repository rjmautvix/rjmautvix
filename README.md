# 👋 Hey there, I'm Rodrigo  

I'm a *Web3 and Blockchain Developer in training*, passionate about building decentralized applications and exploring the Ethereum ecosystem.  
Currently, I'm learning how to *design and develop smart contracts*, manage blockchain infrastructure, and integrate on-chain logic into modern web applications.  

---

## 🚀 What I'm focusing on
- Learning *Solidity* and smart contract development  
- Understanding *Ethereum architecture*, EVM, and gas optimization  
- Exploring *DeFi, **DAOs*, and multi-signature wallets  
- Building practical projects to strengthen my portfolio

## 🧱 My First Web3 Project

Recently, I implemented my *first on-chain project*:  
a *Safe Multi-Signature Wallet* deployed on an Ethereum testnet.  

Through this project, I learned how multi-signature wallets enhance security in decentralized environments by requiring multiple approvals before executing transactions.  
It was a hands-on experience with *real smart contract interaction* and *secure asset management* — a key step toward becoming a professional blockchain developer.
